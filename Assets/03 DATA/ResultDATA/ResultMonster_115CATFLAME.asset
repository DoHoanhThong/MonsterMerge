  monster_id: 115
  monster_ability: The Blazing Feline possesses a unique affinity for fire and harnesses
    its power as both a defensive mechanism and an offensive force. It can manipulate
    flames, creating protective shields of fire that surround its body, granting
    it increased resilience against attacks. The Blazing Feline can also emit searing
    fireballs, launching them with pinpoint accuracy at its adversaries. It possesses
    heightened agility and speed, allowing it to move with swift elegance through
    the fiery landscapes it calls home.
  monster_location: The Blazing Feline is often found in landscapes where fire and
    heat dominate. It favors volcanic regions, arid deserts, and ancient ruins consumed
    by eternal flames. These creatures are drawn to places where the elemental energy
    of fire is strong, and their presence leaves behind scorch marks and trails of
    smoldering embers. The Blazing Feline is known to seek shelter and solace within
    hidden caverns adorned with fiery crystals.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Blazing Feline is significantly longer than
    that of an ordinary cat, spanning several decades. The mystical fusion of feline
    grace and the eternal flame grants it a prolonged existence.
