  monster_ability: 'The Eagke possesses a remarkable special ability: venomous bite
    and sharp talons. Drawing inspiration from its snake lineage, the Eagke has the
    ability to deliver a venomous bite capable of incapacitating prey and foes alike.
    Additionally, it inherits the sharp talons of an eagle, able to pierce through
    flesh and bone with ease. This unique combination of abilities makes the Eagke
    a creature of both lethality and agility. '
  monster_location: 'The Eagke can be found in regions that offer a combination of
    diverse habitats and ample prey. It is often drawn to areas where the natural
    habitats of snakes intersect with the open skies associated with eagles. The
    Eagke thrives in environments such as jungles, deserts, and grasslands, where
    it can utilize its aerial prowess and stealth to hunt and defend its territory.
    It can be seen gliding through the sky or slithering through the underbrush,
    exhibiting a unique combination of snake-like stealth and eagle-like dominance. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Eagke is influenced by various factors, including
    its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific durations
    can vary, Eagke possess a prolonged lifespan due to their snake and eagle heritage.
    They can live for several decades, with some individuals potentially enduring
    for a century or more.
