  monster_ability: The Electrofire possesses the ability to channel and manipulate
    both electric and fire energies simultaneously. It can summon bolts of lightning
    that are tinged with scorching flames, creating electrified infernos that engulf
    its surroundings. The electrofire can generate intense heat and flames infused
    with electric discharges, causing devastating damage to anything it touches.
    It can also create electrified barriers that repel attacks and shock adversaries.
  monster_location: The Electrofire is often found in locations where the elements
    of electricity and fire converge. It is drawn to places such as stormy volcanic
    regions, where lightning strikes meet erupting magma. It can also be found in
    ancient temples or sacred sites where the forces of fire and electricity intertwine.
    These locations become charged with a crackling energy and emit an otherworldly
    glow, marking the presence of the Electrofire
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of an Electrofire is enigmatic and transcends conventional
    understanding.
