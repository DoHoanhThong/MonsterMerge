  monster_ability: 'The Shibawolf possesses a unique blend of abilities derived from
    both the Shiba Inu and wolf realms. It combines the intelligence, loyalty, and
    playful nature of a Shiba Inu with the keen senses, agility, and hunting instincts
    of a wolf. The creature has a remarkable sense of smell, allowing it to track
    scents over long distances. It retains the Shiba Inu''s spirited and independent
    personality while also displaying the cooperative behavior and pack-oriented
    instincts of a wolf. Additionally, the Shibawolf has an endearing charm that
    can win over the hearts of both humans and animals alike. '
  monster_location: 'The Shibawolf can be found in a variety of habitats, often favoring
    regions where the realms of domestic dogs and wolves intersect. It can be encountered
    in forests, grasslands, or even urban environments. The creature is adaptable
    and can thrive in a range of locations as long as it has access to resources
    and the opportunity to display its hunting instincts. It seeks out areas with
    suitable denning sites, water sources, and ample prey or food availability. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Shibawolf is similar to that of a regular Shiba
    Inu or wolf, typically ranging from 12 to 15 years.
