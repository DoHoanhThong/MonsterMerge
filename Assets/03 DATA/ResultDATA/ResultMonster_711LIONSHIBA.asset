  monster_ability: 'The Leoba possesses a remarkable special ability: heightened
    senses and loyalty. Drawing inspiration from its Shiba Inu lineage, the Leoba
    has the ability to sense danger and protect its loved ones with unwavering loyalty.
    Additionally, it inherits the strength and courage of a lion, making it a formidable
    hunter and protector. This unique combination of abilities makes the Leoba a
    creature of both loyalty and courage. '
  monster_location: 'The Leoba can be found in regions that offer a combination of
    diverse habitats and ample prey. It is often drawn to areas where the natural
    habitats of lions intersect with the domesticated environments associated with
    Shiba Inus. The Leoba thrives in environments such as parks, gardens, and neighborhoods,
    where it can utilize its strength and loyalty to protect its territory. It can
    be seen playfully barking or prowling through the grass, exhibiting a unique
    combination of lion-like courage and Shiba Inu-like cuteness. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Leoba is influenced by various factors, including
    its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific durations
    can vary, Leoba possess a prolonged lifespan due to their lion and Shiba Inu
    heritage. They can live for several decades, with some individuals potentially
    enduring for more than a century.
