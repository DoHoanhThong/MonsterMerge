  monster_ability: 'The Tyrannowolf possesses a unique blend of abilities derived
    from both the wolf and T-rex realms. It combines the pack-oriented hunting tactics,
    agility, and enhanced senses of a wolf with the raw power, bone-crushing bite,
    and armored skin of a T-rex. The creature has an incredible sense of smell, allowing
    it to track prey from vast distances. It has formidable jaws capable of delivering
    devastating bites, capable of overpowering even the toughest adversaries. Additionally,
    the Tyrannowolf has a heightened sense of territoriality, fiercely protecting
    its pack and dominating its hunting grounds. '
  monster_location: 'The Tyrannowolf is adaptable to a range of environments, but
    it is often found in regions where the realms of the wolf and dinosaur intersect.
    It can be encountered in dense forests, open grasslands, or rugged mountainous
    areas. The creature is drawn to locations where it can make use of its hunting
    abilities and establish its dominance. It seeks out areas with abundant prey,
    ample water sources, and suitable shelter for its pack. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Tyrannowolf is comparable to that of a regular
    wolf or T-rex, typically ranging from 20 to 30 years.
