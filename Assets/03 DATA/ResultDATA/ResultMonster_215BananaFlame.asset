  monster_ability: 'The Flamana possesses a unique ability to generate intense heat
    and flames, which it can manipulate and project at will. It can summon fireballs,
    create flaming barriers, and unleash scorching breath attacks. Its flames are
    infused with the essence of the banana, giving them an additional corrosive and
    explosive property. This makes the Flamana a formidable adversary, capable of
    inflicting both burn damage and physical harm. '
  monster_location: 'The Flamana typically inhabits tropical regions where bananas
    grow abundantly, often found deep within dense and fiery jungles. It thrives
    in hot and humid environments, taking advantage of the natural resources and
    the searing heat to sustain its fiery nature. The Flamana''s presence can be
    detected by the smoky haze and the distinct scent of burning bananas that fills
    the air. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Flamana is relatively short, typically spanning
    around five to seven years.
