  monster_ability: 'The Lionwolf possesses a unique blend of abilities derived from
    both the wolf and lion realms. It combines the pack-oriented nature, agility,
    and night vision of a wolf with the raw power, ferocity, and regal roar of a
    lion. The creature possesses incredible strength, capable of taking down formidable
    prey and defending its territory against rival predators. It has a commanding
    roar that echoes through the wilderness, instilling fear and asserting dominance.
    Additionally, the Lionwolf has a heightened sense of leadership, inspiring loyalty
    and unity among its pack. '
  monster_location: 'The Lionwolf can be found in a variety of habitats, often favoring
    regions where the realms of the wolf and lion intersect. It can be encountered
    in grasslands, savannahs, or dense forests. The creature is drawn to locations
    where it can make use of its hunting abilities and establish its dominance over
    its territory. It seeks out areas with ample prey, reliable water sources, and
    suitable denning sites for its pack. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Lionwolf is similar to that of a regular wolf
    or lion, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years.
