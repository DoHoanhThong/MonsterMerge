  monster_ability: 'The Elecwolf possesses a unique blend of abilities derived from
    both the wolf and electrical realms. It combines the agility, speed, and pack-oriented
    nature of a wolf with the ability to generate and manipulate electricity. The
    creature can discharge powerful bolts of lightning from its body, capable of
    stunning or incapacitating its enemies. It has an enhanced electrical sense,
    allowing it to detect and navigate through electrical fields or disturbances.
    Additionally, the Elecwolf can cloak itself in an electric field, providing protection
    against physical attacks and serving as a deterrent to potential threats. '
  monster_location: 'The Elecwolf is often found in regions where the realms of the
    wolf and electricity intersect. It can be encountered in areas with high electrical
    activity, such as thunderstorm-prone landscapes, power stations, or places with
    strong electromagnetic fields. The creature is drawn to locations where it can
    harness and channel the power of electricity effectively. It seeks out caves,
    rock formations, or underground tunnels where it can find shelter and amplify
    its electric abilities. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of an Elecwolf is similar to that of a regular wolf,
    ranging from 6 to 10 years.
