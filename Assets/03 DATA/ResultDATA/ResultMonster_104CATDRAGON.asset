  monster_ability: 'Catragon Monster possesses a formidable special ability: the
    power of elemental breath. It can produce and manipulate breath infused with
    the elements of fire, ice, or lightning. This ability allows Catragon to unleash
    powerful and devastating attacks, engulfing its adversaries in flames, freezing
    them in icy tendrils, or electrifying them with bolts of lightning. The choice
    of elemental breath depends on the individual Catragon, with some displaying
    mastery over a single element, while others may control multiple elements.'
  monster_location: The Catragon is commonly found in regions of great natural energy
    and mythical significance. It is often seen in remote and inaccessible areas,
    such as hidden mountain ranges, ancient forests, or mystical realms. These locations
    provide the Catragon with the solitude and tranquility it desires, where it can
    bask in the sun atop lofty peaks or explore secret caves shrouded in mystic energies.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Catragon is remarkably long, spanning several
    centuries. It undergoes a gradual maturation process, starting as a small and
    playful creature with distinct feline characteristics. As it grows older, it
    gains in size and power, developing wings and scales reminiscent of a dragon.
    With each passing century, the Catragon becomes increasingly wise, embodying
    the wisdom of both the dragon and the cat.
