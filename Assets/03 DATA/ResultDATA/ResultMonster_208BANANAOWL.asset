  monster_ability: 'The Owlana possesses a remarkable special ability: the power
    of heightened perception. It has inherited the extraordinary vision and acute
    hearing of an owl, granting it the ability to perceive the world with exceptional
    clarity, even in the darkest of environments. The Owlana can spot minute details
    and movements, making it an exceptional hunter and observer. Its keen senses
    allow it to navigate through the night with ease, detecting even the faintest
    of sounds and movements.'
  monster_location: The Owlana is often found in diverse habitats that encompass
    both lush tropical regions and wooded areas. It is particularly drawn to environments
    where the tropical allure of bananas coincides with the presence of dense forests
    and nocturnal activity. The Owlana is most at home in rainforests, woodlands,
    and quiet groves, where it can fully utilize its heightened senses and blend
    seamlessly with the natural beauty of its surroundings. It can be spotted perched
    gracefully on branches, its banana-like features harmonizing with the darkness
    of the night.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Owlana is influenced by a combination of
    factors, including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While
    specific durations can vary, Owlana generally have a lifespan comparable to that
    of owls. This can range from 10 to 20 years
