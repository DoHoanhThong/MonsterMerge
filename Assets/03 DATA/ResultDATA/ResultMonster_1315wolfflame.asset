    physical and burn damage, making it a deadly adversary. '

    drawn to areas where the elemental forces of fire are prevalent. It roams through
    desolate volcanic plains, charred forests, and fiery mountain ranges. It has
    an affinity for places where the boundary between the physical and elemental
    realms is blurred, and its fiery presence leaves a trail of scorch marks and
    smoldering embers. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Flarewolf is relatively long, spanning several
    decades. Its fiery nature grants it a unique resilience and longevity.
