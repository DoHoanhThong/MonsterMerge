  monster_name: DRAGUIN
  monster_rarity: RARE
  monster_id: 304
  monster_ability: 'The Draguin possesses a truly remarkable special ability: the
    power of flight and ice-breath. Drawing inspiration from its dragon lineage,
    the Draguin can take to the skies with powerful wings and breathe icy blasts
    that freeze its prey or enemies. However, unlike traditional dragons, the Draguin
    wings are flippers, reminiscent of penguins, and its ice-breath has a unique
    icy blue hue. This ability grants the Draguin the power of flight and the ability
    to freeze anything in its path, making it a fearsome predator and a force to
    be reckoned with.'
  monster_location: 'The Draguin is often found in regions that offer a combination
    of icy landscapes and open waters. It is particularly drawn to areas where the
    frigid and icy environments of the poles meet with the vast and open expanses
    of the oceans. The Draguin thrives in environments such as polar regions, icy
    seas, and remote islands, where it can utilize both its flight and swimming abilities
    to hunt and explore. It can be seen soaring majestically through the skies or
    diving gracefully through the icy waters. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Draguin is influenced by a variety of factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Draguin generally have a lifespan comparable to that of penguins.
    This can range from 15 to 20 years
