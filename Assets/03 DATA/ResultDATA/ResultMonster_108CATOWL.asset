  monster_ability: 'The Cowl possesses a remarkable special ability: heightened nocturnal
    senses. It combines the keen vision and stealth of an owl with the agility and
    grace of a cat. This unique combination allows the Cowl to navigate and hunt
    with exceptional precision in low-light conditions. Additionally, it possesses
    the agility of a cat, allowing it to move silently and swiftly, making it an
    incredibly effective nocturnal predator. '
  monster_location: The Cowl is commonly found in forested regions, particularly
    those with dense canopies and ample prey populations. It favors environments
    where it can take advantage of its natural camouflage and blend seamlessly with
    the surrounding foliage. These areas provide the Cowl with the ideal habitat
    to exhibit its hunting skills, as it can silently stalk its prey from the treetops
    and pounce with extraordinary accuracy.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Cowl is relatively similar to that of a domestic
    cat, ranging from 12 to 15 years. It undergoes a growth process reminiscent of
    a cat, starting as a small and curious creature with distinct feline features.
