  monster_ability: 'The Wolgeagle possesses a unique blend of abilities derived from
    both the wolf and eagle realms. It combines the strength, agility, and pack instincts
    of a wolf with the exceptional vision, aerial prowess, and extraordinary diving
    speed of an eagle. The creature can spot prey from great distances, thanks to
    its sharp eyesight. It possesses the ability to traverse vast distances swiftly,
    gliding through the skies with grace and precision. Additionally, the Wolgeagle
    can unleash devastating swooping attacks, using its powerful claws and beak to
    strike with pinpoint accuracy. '
  monster_location: 'The Wolgeagle is adaptable to a range of environments, but it
    is often found in regions where the realms of the wolf and the eagle intersect.
    It can be encountered in expansive mountain ranges, dense forests, and open grasslands.
    The creature is drawn to locations where it can make use of its aerial advantage
    and hunting prowess. It seeks out high cliffs, rocky outcrops, and tall trees,
    which provide vantage points for observing its surroundings and launching swift
    attacks. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Wolgeagle is similar to that of a wolf, ranging
    from 6 to 10 years.
