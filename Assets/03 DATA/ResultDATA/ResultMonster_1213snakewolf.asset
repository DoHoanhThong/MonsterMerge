  monster_ability: 'The Wolfsnake possesses a unique blend of predator skills derived
    from both the wolf and the snake. It combines the speed and endurance of a wolf
    with the stealth and venomous strikes of a snake. The creature''s elongated body
    allows it to slither noiselessly through various terrains, while its sharp fangs
    can deliver a potent venom upon biting. Additionally, the Wolfsnake possesses
    heightened senses, capable of detecting even the faintest of scents and vibrations.
    It can also hypnotize its prey with its compelling gaze, momentarily captivating
    and disorienting them. '
  monster_location: 'The Wolfsnake is adaptable to a range of environments, but it
    is often found in locations where the realms of the wolf and the snake intertwine.
    It can be encountered in dense forests, rocky cliffs, and grassy plains. The
    creature is drawn to regions where it can utilize its stealth and ambush tactics
    effectively. It seeks out areas with hidden crevices, caves, or underground burrows
    that provide shelter and a vantage point for its hunting endeavors. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Wolfsnake is similar to that of a wolf, ranging
    from 6 to 10 years.
