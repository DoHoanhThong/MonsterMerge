  monster_ability: 'The Banectric possesses a remarkable and potent ability derived
    from the fusion of banana and electricity. It can generate, store, and discharge
    electricity, harnessing its power for various purposes. The creature''s touch
    can deliver a mild electric shock or a powerful surge, depending on its intention.
    It can emit electrical discharges that can stun or immobilize adversaries, using
    its electrified presence both defensively and offensively. Additionally, the
    Banectric has the unique ability to absorb and convert electrical energy from
    its surroundings, allowing it to replenish its own power reserves. '
  monster_location: 'The Banectric can be found in regions where the realms of bananas
    and electricity intersect. It is often drawn to areas with abundant electrical
    energy, such as power plants, electrical substations, or regions with strong
    electromagnetic fields. The creature seeks out places where it can harness and
    manipulate electricity, utilizing its powers to their fullest potential. It also
    demonstrates an affinity for tropical or subtropical environments, reflecting
    its banana essence. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Banectric is comparable to that of a regular
    banana or the lifespan of an electrical device, typically ranging from a few
    weeks to a few months.
