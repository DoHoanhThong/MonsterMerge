  monster_ability: 'The Electrocat possesses a unique and potent ability derived
    from the fusion of cat and electricity. It can generate, control, and manipulate
    electricity, utilizing it for various purposes. The creature''s fur becomes charged
    with electrical energy, allowing it to deliver mild shocks to adversaries or
    unleash powerful jolts of electricity when needed. It can emit electrical discharges
    with precision, stunning or immobilizing its foes. Additionally, the Electrocat
    has enhanced sensory perception, detecting electrical fields and disturbances
    in its environment with heightened accuracy. '

    and electricity intersect. It is often drawn to areas with strong electrical
    currents or sources of electricity, such as power stations, laboratories, or
    urban environments with a high concentration of electrical infrastructure. The
    creature seeks out places where it can harness and manipulate electricity, utilizing
    its powers in both playful and defensive ways. It also exhibits an affinity for
    cozy and elevated spots, reflecting its feline essence. '

    cat, typically ranging from 12 to 15 years.
