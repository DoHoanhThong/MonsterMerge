    habitats of snakes intersect with the environments associated with shiba inus.
    The Shibacrawl thrives in environments such as gardens, parks, and forests, where
    it can utilize its agility and venom to hunt and protect its territory. It can
    be seen playing joyfully with its human or animal friends or slithering through
    the grass, exhibiting a unique combination of shiba inu-like playfulness and
    snake-like stealth. '

    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Shibacrawl possess a prolonged lifespan due to their shiba
    inu and snake heritage. They can live for several decades, with some individuals
    potentially enduring for more than a century.
