  monster_ability: 'The Electrocock possesses a unique and awe-inspiring ability
    derived from the fusion of peacock and electricity. It can generate and manipulate
    electricity with remarkable elegance. The creature''s feathers crackle with electric
    energy, granting it enhanced control over its displays of grandeur. It can emit
    dazzling arcs of lightning from its electrified plumage, creating mesmerizing
    and breathtaking spectacles that captivate and astonish onlookers. The Electrocock
    can discharge electrical currents that can stun or immobilize adversaries, utilizing
    them as both a defense mechanism and a display of power. Additionally, it can
    emit electrical pulses that aid in communication with other Electrococks and
    can be used for navigation. '

    peacocks and electricity intersect. It is often drawn to areas with a mix of
    lush and vibrant landscapes, such as tropical rainforests, where electrical storms
    are prevalent. The creature seeks out locations where it can showcase its electrifying
    abilities while blending into the colorful and dense foliage. It is known to
    establish its territory in secluded areas with access to food sources and suitable
    nesting grounds, reflecting its peacock essence. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of an Electrocock is comparable to that of a regular
    peacock, which is typically around 15 to 20 years.
