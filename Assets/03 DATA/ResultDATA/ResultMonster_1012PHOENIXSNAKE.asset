  monster_ability: 'The Snakox possesses a remarkable special ability: regeneration
    and venom. Drawing inspiration from its phoenix lineage, the Snakox has the ability
    to regenerate its body from the ashes, making it virtually indestructible and
    capable of rising anew. Additionally, it inherits the stealth and venomous nature
    of a snake, making it a creature of deadly power and stealth. This unique combination
    of abilities makes the Snakox a creature of both resilience and lethal strength. '
  monster_location: 'The Snakox can be found in regions that offer a combination
    of diverse habitats and ample prey. It is often drawn to areas where the natural
    habitats of phoenixes intersect with the environments associated with snakes.
    The Snakox thrives in environments such as deserts, forests, and mountains, where
    it can utilize its stealth and venom to hunt and protect its territory. It can
    be seen soaring through the sky or slithering through the grass, exhibiting a
    unique combination of phoenix-like majesty and snake-like stealth. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Snakox is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Snakox possess a prolonged lifespan due to their phoenix
    and snake heritage. They can live for several centuries, with some individuals
    potentially enduring for millennia.
