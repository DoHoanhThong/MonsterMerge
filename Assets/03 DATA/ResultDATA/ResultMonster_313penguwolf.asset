  monster_ability: 'The Pengwolf possesses a unique blend of abilities derived from
    both the wolf and penguin realms. It combines the pack-oriented hunting tactics,
    agility, and acute senses of a wolf with the adaptability, diving expertise,
    and swimming prowess of a penguin. The creature is an exceptional swimmer, capable
    of diving deep into the water and maneuvering with precision. It has a streamlined
    body that aids in swift underwater movement, allowing it to catch prey with ease.
    Additionally, the Pengwolf has a remarkable sense of camaraderie, fostering strong
    social bonds within its pack and displaying cooperative behavior. '
  monster_location: 'The Pengwolf can be found in regions where the realms of the
    wolf and penguin intersect. It can be encountered in coastal areas, islands,
    or regions with ample water sources. The creature is drawn to locations where
    it can make use of its swimming abilities and access a variety of prey. It seeks
    out rocky shores, ice floes, or secluded beaches where it can nest and raise
    its young. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of a Pengwolf is comparable to that of a regular
    wolf or penguin, typically ranging from 15 to 20 years.
