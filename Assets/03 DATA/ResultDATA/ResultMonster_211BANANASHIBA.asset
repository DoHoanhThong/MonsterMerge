  monster_ability: 'The Shibana possesses a unique and delightful special ability:
    the power of banana transformation. Drawing inspiration from its banana heritage,
    the Baniba Monster can transform its appearance into that of a banana at will.
    It can seamlessly mimic the shape, color, and texture of a ripe banana, allowing
    it to blend in with its surroundings or surprise unsuspecting onlookers. This
    ability adds an element of surprise and amusement to its interactions, making
    it a creature of joy and playfulness.'
  monster_location: The Shibana is often found in regions that offer a combination
    of tropical beauty and playful environments. It is particularly drawn to areas
    where the tropical essence of bananas harmonizes with open spaces and lively
    surroundings. The Shibana thrives in environments such as sunny meadows, parks,
    and beachfronts, where it can frolic and explore to its heart's content. It can
    be seen bounding joyfully through its habitat, its banana-like features adding
    a touch of whimsy to its lively presence.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Shibana is comparable to that of a Shiba
    Inu. On average, Shibana have a lifespan ranging from 12 to 15 years.
