    display and keen eyesight. Drawing inspiration from its peacock lineage, the
    Peagle Monster has the ability to mesmerize prey and foes alike with its hypnotic
    display of colorful feathers. Additionally, it inherits the keen eyesight of
    an eagle, capable of spotting prey from great distances and detecting even the
    slightest movements. This unique combination of abilities makes the Peagle Monster
    a creature of both beauty and strength. '
  monster_location: 'The Peagle Monster can be found in regions that offer a combination
    of diverse habitats and ample food sources. It is often drawn to areas where
    the natural habitats of peacocks intersect with the open skies associated with
    eagles. The Peagle Monster thrives in environments such as forests, mountains,
    and savannas, where it can utilize its aerial prowess and stunning display to
    hunt and defend its territory. It can be seen soaring through the sky or displaying
    its feathers, exhibiting a unique combination of peacock-like beauty and eagle-like
    grace. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Peagle Monster is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Peagle Monsters possess a prolonged lifespan due to their
    peacock and eagle heritage. They can live for several decades, with some individuals
    potentially enduring for a century or more.
