  monster_ability: 'The Shibea possesses a remarkable special ability: heightened
    senses and loyalty. Drawing inspiration from its Shiba Inu lineage, the Shibea
    has the ability to detect scents and sounds with remarkable accuracy, making
    it an excellent tracker. Additionally, it inherits the loyalty and playfulness
    of a Shiba Inu, making it a friendly and faithful companion. This unique combination
    of abilities makes the Shibea a creature of both perceptiveness and loyalty. '
  monster_location: 'The Shibea can be found in regions that offer a combination
    of diverse habitats and ample food sources. It is often drawn to areas where
    the natural habitats of Shiba Inus intersect with the open skies associated with
    eagles. The Shibea thrives in environments such as forests, mountains, and grasslands,
    where it can utilize its aerial prowess and heightened senses to hunt and defend
    its territory. It can be seen playing fetch with its owner or soaring through
    the sky, exhibiting a unique combination of Shiba Inu-like loyalty and eagle-like
    adventurism. '
  monster_lifespan: Shibea possess a prolonged lifespan due to their Shiba Inu and
    eagle heritage. They can live for several decades, with some individuals potentially
    enduring for a century or more.
