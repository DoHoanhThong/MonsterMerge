  monster_ability: 'The Electrolion possesses a unique and potent ability derived
    from the fusion of lion and electricity. It can generate, conduct, and discharge
    electricity with remarkable prowess. The creature''s mane crackles with electrical
    energy, allowing it to create a dazzling display of sparks and lightning. It
    can channel electricity through its claws, enhancing its already formidable strength
    and delivering electrifying strikes to adversaries. The Electrolion''s roar becomes
    infused with electrical energy, capable of stunning and disorienting enemies.
    Additionally, it can emit electric pulses from its body, creating a protective
    field that repels or incapacitates threats. '
  monster_location: 'The Electrolion can be found in regions where the realms of
    lions and electricity intersect. It is often drawn to areas with a mix of open
    savannahs, such as grasslands with frequent thunderstorms or places with a significant
    presence of electrical activity. The creature seeks out locations where it can
    harness and channel the power of electricity, utilizing its abilities for hunting,
    territorial defense, and asserting dominance. It is known to establish its pride
    in secluded areas with ample prey and access to water, reflecting its lion essence. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of an Electrolion is comparable to that of a regular
    lion, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years in the wild.
