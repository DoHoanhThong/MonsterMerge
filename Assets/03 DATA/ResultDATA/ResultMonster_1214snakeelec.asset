  monster_ability: 'The Electrosnake possesses a unique and potent ability derived
    from the fusion of snake and electricity. It can generate, channel, and discharge
    electricity with remarkable control. The creature''s body becomes an electrified
    conduit, allowing it to deliver electric shocks to adversaries or unleash lightning-fast
    strikes with its fangs. It can emit electrical pulses that disrupt the nervous
    systems of its prey or foes, leaving them stunned and vulnerable. Additionally,
    the Electrosnake has excellent camouflage skills, blending into its surroundings
    and becoming virtually undetectable, thanks to the electrical energy that envelops
    its scales. '
  monster_location: 'The Electrosnake can be found in regions where the realms of
    snakes and electricity intersect. It is often drawn to areas with high electrical
    activity, such as dense forests with thunderstorms, underground caverns with
    conductive minerals, or places with a significant presence of electrical infrastructure.
    The creature seeks out locations where it can harness and manipulate electricity,
    utilizing its abilities for hunting and protection. It also exhibits an affinity
    for warm and damp environments, reflecting its snake essence. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of an Electrosnake is comparable to that of a regular
    snake, typically ranging from 10 to 20 years depending on the species.
