  monster_ability: 'The Dragoenix possesses a remarkable special ability: the power
    of resurrection and elemental manipulation. Drawing inspiration from its phoenix
    lineage, the Dragoenix has the ability to resurrect itself from its own ashes,
    making it almost invincible. It can also manipulate elemental forces such as
    fire, wind, and lightning, unleashing devastating attacks on its foes. This unique
    combination of powers makes the Dragoenix a fearsome and unstoppable force.'
  monster_location: The Dragoenix is often found in regions that offer a combination
    of diverse habitats and untamed wilderness. It is particularly drawn to areas
    where the domains of phoenixes intersect with the mythical realms associated
    with dragons. The Dragoenix thrives in environments such as deserts, volcanic
    landscapes, and rugged mountain ranges, where it can utilize its mastery of elemental
    powers. It can be seen soaring through the skies or perched majestically on rocky
    outcrops, exhibiting a unique combination of phoenix-like beauty and dragon-like
    power.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Dragoenix is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Dragoenix possess an extended lifespan due to their phoenix
    and dragon heritage. They can live for several centuries, with some individuals
    potentially existing for thousands of years.
