  monster_ability: 'The Electrowl possesses a unique and potent ability derived from
    the fusion of owl and electricity. It can harness and manipulate electrical energy
    with remarkable finesse. The creature''s feathers crackle with electricity, granting
    it enhanced stealth and the ability to emit dazzling displays of light. It can
    generate and control electrical discharges, using them as defensive shields or
    as offensive projectiles. The Electrowl''s acute senses are further heightened
    by its electrical essence, allowing it to detect and analyze minute electrical
    signals in its surroundings. Additionally, it can emit electrical pulses that
    disorient or stun its prey or adversaries. '
  monster_location: 'The Electrowl can be found in regions where the realms of owls
    and electricity intersect. It is often drawn to areas with a mix of dense vegetation,
    such as forests with a high concentration of electrical storms, or places with
    an abundance of electrical infrastructure. The creature seeks out locations where
    it can blend into the darkness and utilize its electrifying abilities for hunting
    and survival. It is known to establish nests in secluded and elevated areas,
    reflecting its owl essence. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of an Electrowl is comparable to that of a regular
    owl, typically ranging from 10 to 20 years depending on the species.
