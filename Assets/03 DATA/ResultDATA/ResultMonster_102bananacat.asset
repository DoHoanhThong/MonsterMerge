  monster_ability: 'Catbana Monster possesses an extraordinary special ability: the
    power of shape-shifting. It has the uncanny ability to alter its form, seamlessly
    transitioning between a banana-like appearance and that of a feline. This shape-shifting
    ability allows the Banacat Monster to adapt to its surroundings and camouflage
    itself effectively, making it an elusive and formidable creature.'
  monster_location: Catbana is primarily found in lush, tropical environments. It
    thrives in regions abundant with dense vegetation, such as rainforests and jungles,
    where it can take advantage of both its banana and cat attributes. Due to its
    inherent adaptability, it can also inhabit urban and suburban areas, blending
    in seamlessly with its surroundings, much like a stray cat.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Catbana is relatively long, extending up
    to 25 years. This longevity is a result of the combination of the banana's inherent
    hardiness and the cat's natural resilience. The creature undergoes a series of
    transformations throughout its lifespan, much like a cat's life stages, from
    playful kittenhood to mature adulthood.
