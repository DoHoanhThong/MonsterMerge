    habitats of lions intersect with the environments associated with dragons and
    dinosaurs. The Leviathan thrives in environments such as savannas, grasslands,
    and forests, where it can utilize its raw power and elemental fire to hunt and
    protect its territory. It can be seen prowling through the grasslands or soaring
    through the skies, exhibiting a unique combination of lion-like ferocity, dragon-like
    majesty, and dinosaur-like strength. '
