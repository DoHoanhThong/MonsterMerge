    creature of both destructive power and commanding presence. '

    of diverse habitats and ample prey. It is often drawn to areas where the natural
    habitats of lions intersect with the environments associated with phoenixes.

    where it can utilize its strength and fire to hunt and protect its territory.
    It can be seen prowling through the grasslands or soaring through the skies,
    exhibiting a unique combination of lion-like ferocity and phoenix-like majesty. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Quixotic is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Quixotic possess a prolonged lifespan due to their phoenix
    and lion heritage. They can live for several decades, with some individuals potentially
    enduring for more than a century.
