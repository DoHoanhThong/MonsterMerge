  monster_ability: 'The Numinous possesses a remarkable special ability: regeneration
    and fire. Drawing inspiration from its phoenix lineage, the Numinous has the
    ability to regenerate its body from the ashes and produces intense flames. Additionally,
    it inherits the grace and agility of a domestic cat, making it a creature of
    swift movement and precision. This unique combination of abilities makes the
    Numinous a creature of both resilience and fiery grace. '
  monster_location: 'The Numinous can be found in regions that offer a combination
    of diverse habitats and ample prey. It is often drawn to areas where the natural
    habitats of domestic cats intersect with the environments associated with phoenixes.
    The Numinous thrives in environments such as gardens, forests, and mountains,
    where it can utilize its agility and fire to hunt and protect its territory.
    It can be seen playing joyfully with its human or animal friends or soaring through
    the sky, exhibiting a unique combination of cat-like grace and phoenix-like majesty. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Numinous is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. Numinous possess
    a prolonged lifespan due to their phoenix and cat heritage. They can live for
    several decades, with some individuals potentially enduring for more than a century.
