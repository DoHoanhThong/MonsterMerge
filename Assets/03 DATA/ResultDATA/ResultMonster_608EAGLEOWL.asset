  monster_ability: 'The Eaglowl Monster possesses a remarkable special ability: night
    vision and silent flight. Drawing inspiration from its owl lineage, the Eaglowl
    has the ability to see in the dark, making it a formidable predator during the
    night. Additionally, it inherits the silent flight of an owl, allowing it to
    move with stealth and grace, undetected by prey and foes alike. This unique combination
    of abilities makes the Eaglowl a creature of both perceptiveness and elusiveness. '
  monster_location: 'The Eaglowl can be found in regions that offer a combination
    of diverse habitats and ample food sources. It is often drawn to areas where
    the natural habitats of owls intersect with the open skies associated with eagles.
    The Eaglowl thrives in environments such as forests, mountains, and grasslands,
    where it can utilize its nocturnal advantage and aerial mastery to hunt and defend
    its territory. It can be seen gliding through the night sky or perched atop a
    tree, exhibiting a unique combination of owl-like wisdom and eagle-like majesty. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Eaglowl is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Eaglowl possess a prolonged lifespan due to their owl and
    eagle heritage. They can live for several decades, with some individuals potentially
    enduring for a century or more.
