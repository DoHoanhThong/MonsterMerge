  monster_ability: 'The Dragle Monster possesses a remarkable special ability: the
    power of flight and elemental control. Drawing inspiration from its dragon lineage,
    the Dragle Monster can take to the skies with the agility and speed of an eagle,
    effortlessly gliding through the air and surveying vast landscapes with its keen
    eyesight. Additionally, it inherits the ability to control and harness elemental
    forces, such as fire, wind, and lightning. This unique combination allows the
    Dragle Monster to unleash devastating elemental attacks while maintaining the
    grace and precision of an eagle in its aerial maneuvers. '
  monster_location: 'The Dragle Monster is often found in regions that offer a combination
    of expansive skies and rugged terrain. It is particularly drawn to areas where
    the habitats of eagles intersect with the mythical realms associated with dragons.
    The Dragle Monster thrives in environments such as mountain ranges, deep valleys,
    and cliffside habitats, where it can utilize its mastery of flight and elemental
    powers. It can be seen soaring high above the mountaintops or perched majestically
    on a precipice, exhibiting a unique combination of eagle-like elegance and dragon-like
    power. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Dragle Monster is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Dragle Monsters possess an extended lifespan due to their
    eagle and dragon heritage
