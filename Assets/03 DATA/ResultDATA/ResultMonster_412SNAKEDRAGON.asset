  monster_rarity: RARE
  monster_id: 412
  monster_ability: 'The Dratini possesses a remarkable special ability: venomous
    breath and shape-shifting. Drawing inspiration from its snake lineage, the Dratini
    can exhale a deadly venomous breath, capable of incapacitating or even fatally
    poisoning its adversaries. Additionally, it inherits the ability to shape-shift,
    allowing it to assume different forms and sizes, making it a formidable foe to
    confront. This unique combination of powers makes the Dratini a feared and adaptable
    creature.'
  monster_location: 'The Dratini can be found in regions that offer a combination
    of diverse habitats and hidden lairs. It is often drawn to areas where the natural
    habitats of snakes intersect with the mythical realms associated with dragons.
    The Dratini thrives in environments such as dense jungles, deep caves, and secluded
    marshlands, where it can utilize its stealth and cunning. It can be seen slithering
    through the underbrush or coiled menacingly in dark corners, exhibiting a unique
    combination of snake-like agility and dragon-like power. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Dratini is influenced by various factors,
    including its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific
    durations can vary, Dratini possess an extended lifespan due to their snake and
    dragon heritage. They can live for several centuries, with some individuals potentially
    existing for thousands of years.
