  monster_ability: 'The Kelagon possesses a unique and potent special ability: the
    power of elemental fire. It harnesses the innate dragon fire within, allowing
    it to breathe intense flames that can scorch and incinerate its surroundings.
    The flames of the Kelagon possess a distinct banana-like essence, infusing them
    with a tropical aroma as they engulf their targets. It can manipulate fire with
    remarkable precision, unleashing fiery projectiles and creating blazing paths
    with its every movement.'
  monster_location: The Kelagon is typically found in volcanic regions and lush tropical
    landscapes. It is drawn to areas where the power of fire and the abundance of
    vegetation converge, finding solace amidst the vibrant foliage and the raw energy
    of volcanic activity. The Kelagon feels most at home in dense jungles, fiery
    caverns, and secluded volcanic islands, where it can bask in the warmth and unleash
    its fiery abilities without causing widespread destruction.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Kelagon is a testament to its mythical nature.
    It exists outside the boundaries of mortal lifespans, enduring through the ages
    as long as its draconic essence remains. While the exact duration of its lifespan
    is unknown
