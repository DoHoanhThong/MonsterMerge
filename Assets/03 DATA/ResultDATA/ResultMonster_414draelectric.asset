  monster_ability: 'The Dralectro possesses an extraordinary and potent ability derived
    from the fusion of dragon and electricity. It harnesses and controls electricity
    with immense power. The creature generates and channels lightning bolts, unleashing
    devastating electrical attacks upon its adversaries. Its scales act as conduits,
    conducting and amplifying electrical energy, providing it with enhanced protection
    against electric-based attacks. The Dralectro can also fly effortlessly through
    stormy skies, drawing energy from thunderstorms and charging its own power reserves.
    Additionally, it can emit electrical pulses that disrupt and disable technological
    devices within its vicinity. '
  monster_location: 'The Dralectro can be found in regions where the realms of dragons
    and electricity intersect. It is often drawn to areas with strong electrical
    phenomena, such as thunderous mountains, stormy coastlines, or places with a
    high concentration of electrical energy, such as power plants or lightning-rich
    environments. The creature seeks out locations where it can harness and amplify
    the power of electricity, utilizing its abilities in both offensive and defensive
    ways. It is also known to establish lairs in cavernous spaces, deep within the
    heart of electrified landscapes. '
  monster_lifespan: 'The lifespan of a Dralectro is comparable to that of a regular
    dragon, typically spanning several centuries. '
