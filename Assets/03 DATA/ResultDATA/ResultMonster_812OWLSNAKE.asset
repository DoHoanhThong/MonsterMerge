  monster_ability: 'The Snowl possesses a remarkable special ability: stealth and
    venom. Drawing inspiration from its snake lineage, the Snowl has the ability
    to move with incredible stealth and strike with venomous fangs. Additionally,
    it inherits the wisdom and nocturnal prowess of an owl, making it a creature
    of great insight and hunting ability. This unique combination of abilities makes
    the Snowl a creature of both deadly stealth and wise skill. '
  monster_location: 'The Snowl can be found in regions that offer a combination of
    diverse habitats and ample prey. It is often drawn to areas where the natural
    habitats of owls intersect with the grassy environments associated with snakes.
    The Snowl thrives in environments such as deserts, grasslands, and forests, where
    it can utilize its stealth and venom to hunt and protect its territory. It can
    be seen slithering silently through the grass or soaring silently through the
    night, exhibiting a unique combination of owl-like wisdom and snake-like stealth. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Snowl is influenced by various factors, including
    its genetic makeup and the environment it inhabits. While specific durations
    can vary, Snowl possess a prolonged lifespan due to their owl and snake heritage.
    They can live for several decades, with some individuals potentially enduring
    for more than a century.
