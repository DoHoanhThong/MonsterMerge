  monster_ability: 'The Inferno Shiba possesses a unique ability to manipulate and
    harness flames with remarkable dexterity. It can conjure fireballs that it playfully
    tosses around, creating a mesmerizing display of dancing flames. The Inferno
    Shiba''s paws emit a gentle heat, allowing it to leave fiery footprints or scorch
    the ground with each step. It can also emit fiery barks that resonate with an
    enchanting warmth, captivating those who hear it. Additionally, the Inferno Shiba
    has an innate sense of fire-related phenomena, enabling it to navigate through
    smoke and detect hidden sources of heat. '
  monster_location: 'The Inferno Shiba is often found in places where fire is naturally
    present or where the element of fire is celebrated. It seeks out warm and fiery
    environments, such as volcanic regions, hot springs, or even bonfire gatherings.
    The creature is drawn to locations where the contrast between its fiery nature
    and the surrounding environment is most pronounced. It can also be found in areas
    where the vibrant colors of autumn foliage mirror its fiery coat. '
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of an Inferno Shiba is similar to that of a regular
    Shiba Inu, averaging between 12 to 15 years.
