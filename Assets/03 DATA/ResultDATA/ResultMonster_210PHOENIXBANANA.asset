  monster_ability: 'The Phoenanana possesses a truly extraordinary special ability:
    the power of rebirth and regeneration. Drawing inspiration from the phoenix,
    the Phoenanana has the ability to engulf itself in flames, only to rise from
    the ashes in a magnificent display of rebirth. However, unlike the traditional
    phoenix, the flames that envelope the Phoenanana have a tropical essence, reminiscent
    of the vibrant allure of bananas. This ability grants the Phoenanana the power
    of regeneration, allowing it to heal and rejuvenate itself from any injuries
    or ailments. It is a symbol of resilience and renewal, embodying the eternal
    cycle of life.'
  monster_location: The Phoenanana is often found in regions where the tropical essence
    of bananas coincides with the presence of mythical energy and fiery landscapes.
    It is attracted to areas that combine lush vegetation with volcanic activity
    or volcanic-like environments. The Phoenanana can be found in volcanic regions,
    tropical islands, and areas with geothermal activity. It thrives amidst the vibrant
    greenery and fiery landscapes, its banana-like features subtly glowing with an
    inner warmth.
  monster_lifespan: The lifespan of the Phoenanana is known to be extraordinary,
    reflecting the mythical and immortal nature of the phoenix. While precise durations
    are uncertain, Phoenanana are said to have lifespans that extend far beyond the
    limits of ordinary creatures. They are believed to live for centuries
